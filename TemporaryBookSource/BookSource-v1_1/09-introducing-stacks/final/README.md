#  Kuchi Flash Cards

Kuchi Flash Cards is a simple flash card app for learning languages whilst traveling. It allows the user to add new words, phrases, and characters to decks, then later test themselves from the set decks, or quickly access phrases for common situations, such as eating, socializing, or working.

The app will have a landing scene where they can select to test themselves or access a pre-made deck (for editing or viewing). Decks and the contents of decks can be listed (for editing or viewing).
